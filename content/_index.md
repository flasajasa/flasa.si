# Hey, I'm Jaša 👋

I'm a Platform Engineer at [Sportradar](https://sportradar.com) in Ljubljana, where I build tools and infrastructure that make developers' lives easier. My work revolves around **Go**, automation, and creating solutions that streamline engineering workflows.

## What I Do

I spend most of my time crafting internal tooling—CLI applications, Go libraries, and CI/CD automation that help development teams move faster and more confidently. There's something deeply satisfying about solving the small, repetitive problems that compound into big productivity gains.

My focus areas include:
- **Go development** for internal tooling and libraries
- **Developer experience** through intuitive CLI tools
- **CI/CD automation** across the software lifecycle
- **Platform engineering** that balances technical excellence with usability

## Beyond Code

When I'm not engineering solutions, you'll find me on the tennis court. I'm a licensed tennis coach and have a passion for racket sports.

If you want to chat about Go, platform engineering, or tennis, feel free to reach out.
