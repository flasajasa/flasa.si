# Hey, I'm Jaša 👋

I'm a Platform Engineer at [Sportradar](https://sportradar.com) in Ljubljana, where I build tools and infrastructure that make developers' lives easier. My work revolves around **Go**, automation, and creating solutions that streamline engineering workflows for developers.

## What I Build

I specialize in creating internal developer tooling that solves real problems at scale:

**CLI Tools & Automation**  
I've built and maintain a suite of Go-based command-line tools used company-wide. My AWS credential management tool handles authentication for 50+ engineers daily, while my Terraform Enterprise automation tools streamline infrastructure deployments across multiple teams.

**Terraform Provider**  
I engineered a custom Terraform provider for internal APIs, enabling infrastructure-as-code workflows with built-in retry logic, error handling, and datasource support for Kubernetes clusters and AWS resources.

**CI/CD & Code Quality**  
I maintain comprehensive automation covering the entire development lifecycle—testing, building, linting, releasing, and publishing. This includes advanced linting configurations and static analysis tools that catch bugs before they reach production.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:** Go (primary), Python, JavaScript, Bash  
**Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, GitLab CI/CD, Terraform, Docker, Podman  
**Development:** GraphQL, REST APIs, Gatsby, Git  
**Monitoring:** CloudWatch, Grafana

## Current Focus

Right now I'm working on improving developer experience through better tooling, reducing friction in deployment processes, and making platform services more self-service. I believe the best infrastructure is the kind developers don't have to think about.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not engineering solutions, you'll find me on the tennis court. I'm a licensed tennis coach and have a passion for racket sports—there's an interesting parallel between optimizing athletic performance and optimizing code.
